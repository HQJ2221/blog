### Human Relations Management

- Focus on people and sees them as valuable organisational resources in their own right.
- **Mary Parker Follett's constructive conflict and coordination** -- Parties in a conflict should engaging in integrative conflict resolution instead of *dominating the other party* or *compromising*
- **Chester Barnard** -- theory of cooperation in formal organisations (defined as a system of consciously coordinated activities or forces created by two or more people)
- **"Hawthorne Effect": Elton Mayo** concluded that people's behavior and attitudes are closely related, so that group factors significantly affect individual behavior. 
	- money is less a factor in determining output than group standards and group attitudes.
- Org' are managed on
	- how managers design jobs
	- how managers work with employee teams
	- how managers communicate with others



### System Management & Contingency【意外事故】 Management

- **System Management** requires manager to think problems as a whole, including something even irrelevant.

<img src="8.png" style="zoom:50%">

- **Contingency Management** demand managers' ability to cope with different types of problems, so there are no fixed approaches to offer.

	<td><img src="11.png"></td>
</tr>
</table>

- The **ethical answers** that managers choose depend on:
	- **ethical intensity** of the decision
	- **moral development** of the manager
	- **ethical principles** to solve the problems

<img src="12.png" style="zoom:50%">



## Ethical decision making: approaches 

### 4 basic approaches

- The utilitarian approach 【效率】
	- focuses on **consequences** of an action using a utilitarian approach (try to make decisions that result in "greatest good")
	- but this *good* may be **subjective**
- The moral rights approach 【规矩】
	- focuses on an examination of the moral standing of actions **independent of their consequences**.
	- choose the action that conforms with moral principles and provides positive consequences.
- The universal approach 【普适】
	- choosing a course of action that you believe can **apply to all** people under all situations
- The justice approach 【投产比】
	- focuses on the equity of **process** and **outcomes**.
	- Distributive justice, Procedural justice, Compensatory justice, etc.

### Steps for ethical decision making

- **Selecting and Hiring Ethical Employees**: overt and personality-based integrity tests
- **Codes of Ethics**:  
	1. communicate its code to others both inside and outside the company 
	2. develop practical ethical standards and procedures specific to the company’s line of business.
- **Ethics Training**:  
	1. To create an ethical company culture  
	2. To achieve credibility with employees  
	3. To teach employees a practical model of ethical decision making
- **Ethical Climate establishment**:  
	1. Top managers act ethically  
	2. Top management actively participate in the company ethics program  
	3. Put in place a **reporting system** that encourages managers and employees to **report potential ethics violations** i.e. whistle-blowing

### Steps to encourage valid whistle-blowing:

1. Clearly communicate whistle-blowing procedures to all employees. 【公开】
2. Allow for reporting channels in addition to the chain of command or reporting incidents to one’s boss. 【制定规则】
3. Thoroughly investigate all claims based on a consistent procedure.   
4. Protect whistle-blowers who make valid claims. 【鼓励】
5. Provide moderate financial incentives or rewards for valid claims.  【鼓励】
6. Publicly celebrate employees who make valid claims.【鼓励】



### Basic Model for Ethic Decision Making

1. Identify problems

## Social responsibility

- **Def.** Social responsibility is a business’s obligation to pursue policies, make decisions, and take actions that benefit society.
	- *shareholder model/efficiency perspective* — the only social responsibility that businesses have is to *maximize profits*
	- *stakeholder model/social responsibility perspective* — management’s most important responsibility is the firm’s **long-term survival**

<img src="26.png" style="zoom: 50%">

> 通过观察企业是否损害了 shareholders 的利益，判断企业是否对“效率”（Efficiency）负责
>
> 通过观察企业是否损害了 stakeholders 的利益，判断企业是否对“社会责任”（Social Responsibility）负责



### How organizations respond

- <font color=red><b>Social responsiveness</b></font> refers to a company’s strategy to respond to stakeholders’ economic, legal, ethical, or discretionary expectations concerning social responsibility
1. **Reactive**: Company does **less than** society expect
2. **Defensive**: Company admits responsibility for a problem but does the least required to meet societal expectation
3. **Accommodative**: Company accepts responsibility for a problem and does all that society expects to solve the problem
4. **Proactive**: Company anticipates a problem before it occurs and does more than society expects

# Section 5. Planning

## Basic Concepts

- **Goal**: a desired future condition that the organisation attempts to achieve
- **Plan**: a blueprint for *goal achievement* and specifies the necessary resource allocations, schedules, tasks and other actions

> So what is planning?

- **Planning**：choosing a goal and developing methods or strategies to achieve the goal

## Organisational Goals

**Recap**: Types of Managers

<img src="13.png" style="zoom:50%">

> Then we extend to Levels of Goals and Plans

<img src="14.png" style="zoom:50%">

> Then who sets the goals?

- Each manager's responsibility for setting goals is **determined by his/her level** within the organization
- Goals are often negotiated between managers; it is important to set realistic goals and to ensure consensus(意见一致)

<img src="27.png" style="zoom:50%">

### Rules of setting goals

- **Be SMART**: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Timely 
- **Be committed**: to develop commitment by
	- involving employees in particular goal-setting,
	- making the goal public,  
	- obtaining support from top management.
- When there are multiple goals:
	- Potential *conflicts* between goals
	- To address potential conflicts, managers should understand optimisation: recognising the conflicts between goals and making balance and coordination



## Organisational Planning

### Planning process

<img src="15.png" style="zoom:40%">

### Planning in different levels

<img src="16.png" style="zoom:50%">

> See another picture to better comprehend

<img src="17.png" style="zoom:50%">

- **Management by Objectives (MBO)** was first outlined by Peter Drucker in 1954
- "Management by Objectives works if you know the objectives, 90% of the time you don't."
- Model of MBO Process:

<img src="18.png" style="zoom:50%">

- MBO benefits:
	- focuses efforts on activities that lead to goal attainment
	- improve performance at all company levels
	- improve employee motivation
	- align individual/department goals with company goals



## Planning for a turbulent/uncertain environment

### Contingency planning

- **Rapid and uncertain environmental changes**: technological, social, economic etc.
- **Contingency planning** respond to emergencies
- How to develop?
	- <font color=red>identify</font> important env factors
	- <font color=red>forecast</font> alternatives responses to likely cases(especially worst)

### Crisis Management

> 涉及到一些规模较大，较紧急的事件，多数为外部环境因素。如 COVID-19，经济危机等

- Prevention & Preparation:
	- detect signal from env
	- designate crisis management team and spokesperson
- set up information systems
- need future-ready researches



## Innovative planning strategies

### Decentralized planning

- Example: <font color=dodgerblue>Top managers</font> or planning experts work with managers in major devisions/departments to develop their own goals and plans【扁平化管理】

### Stretch goals

- Goals that are reasonable but highly ambitious and compelling【超高目标？激发潜能？】



# Section 6. Decision Making

## Basic Concepts

- **Decision**: a choice made from available alternatives
- Types of decision-making
	- **Programmed decisions**: made for situation that has occurred often enough(predictable)
	- **Non-programmed decisions**: made for unique situation(unpredictable) which affect consequence importantly

### Programmed vs. Non-programmed Decisions

| **Characteristic**       | **Programmed**    | **Non-programmed**   |
| :----------------------: | :---------------: | :------------------: |
| Problem Type             | Structured        | Unstructured         |
| Managerial Level         | Lower levels      | Upper levels         |
| Information Availability | Readily available | Ambiguous/Incomplete |
| Solution Basis           | Rules/Policies    | Judgment/Creativity  |



## Decision-Making Models

### 1. **Classical Model**  

- **Assumptions**:  
  - Clear goals, complete information, rational choice.  
  - Maximizes economic returns.  
- **Type**: Normative/Prescriptive.  

### 2. **Administrative Model**  

- **Assumptions**:  
  - Bounded rationality, satisficing.  
  - Vague goals, limited information.  
- **Type**: Descriptive.  

### 3. **Political Model**  

- **Assumptions**:  
  - Conflicts among coalitions.  
  - Bargaining under uncertainty.  
- **Focus**: Group dynamics and negotiation. 

### <font color=dodgerblue>Comparison</font>

<img src="29.png" style="zoom:50%">



## Decision-Making Steps  

> 6 steps as a circle

1. **Recognize Requirement** (Problem/Opportunity).  
2. **Diagnose Causes** (Analyze underlying factors).  
3. **Develop Alternatives** (Programmed vs. Non-programmed).  
4. **Select Alternative** (Align with goals, risk propensity).  
5. **Implement** (Managerial persuasion).  
6. **Evaluate & Feedback** (Monitor outcomes).



## Individual and group decision-making

| **Individual**       | **Group**                      |
| :------------------: | :----------------------------: |
| Faster               | Slower (time-consuming)        |
| Limited perspectives | Diverse ideas/knowledge        |
| Risk of bias         | Reduced bias (if managed well) |
| Accountability clear | Potential for groupthink       |

**Group Techniques**:  
- Brainstorming (no criticism).  
- Nominal Group Technique (ranking ideas).  
- Delphi Technique (expert consensus).  



# Section 7. Organizational Strategy

- **Strategy** is the plan of action that describes resource allocation and activities for dealing with the environment, achieving a competitive advantage, and attaining the organization's goals.
	- **Resource**: Plan for resource allocation to achieve competitive advantage.
	- **Competitive Advantage**: Unique edge in meeting market needs (e.g., BYD’s battery tech).
	- **Sustainable Competitive Advantage**: Advantage that competitors cannot replicate.
		- Valuable, Rare, Imperfectly imitable or Non-substitutable resources.
	
> To think of Effective strategy:

- What business we are in ?
- How should we compete in this industry ?
- Who are your competitors, and how should we respond to them ?



## Types of Organizational Strategies

### 1. **Corporate Strategies**  
|   **Type**    |                               **Focus**                                |
| :-----------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  **Growth**   | Expansion via new markets/products (e.g., BYD’s vertical integration). |
| **Stability** |                      Maintain current operations.                      |
|  **Renewal**  |  Address declining performance (retrenchment/turnaround strategies).   |

#### Growth Subtypes:
- **Concentration**: Focus on core business.
- **Vertical Integration**: Control supply chain (e.g., BYD’s battery production).
- **Diversification**:  
	- *Related*: New products in related markets.  
	- *Unrelated*: New products in unrelated markets (higher risk).

### 2. **Competitive Strategies** (Porter’s)  
| **Strategy**          | **Key Features**   |
|:-:|:-:|

| **Differentiation**   | Unique product/service (e.g., Tesla’s tech innovation).                        |
| **Focus**             | Target niche markets (e.g., luxury EVs).                                       |



## Strategic Tools

### The BCG Matrix

- **Stars**: large share of a fast-growing market
- **Question marks**: have a small share of a fast-growing market
- **Cash cows**: have a large share of a slow-growing market
- **Dogs**: have a small share of a declining market

## Steps for strategy making

1. **Assess Need for Change**  
   - Overcome *competitive inertia* (resistance to change).  
2. **Situational Analysis (SWOT)**  
   - **Strengths**: R&D capability, flexible production (BYD).  
   - **Weaknesses**: Limited high-end market presence.  
   - **Opportunities**: Government EV policies, global expansion.  
   - **Threats**: Intense competition (Tesla, Xiaomi).  
3. **Choose Strategic Alternatives**  
   - Use strategic reference points (risk-averse vs. risk-taking decisions).  

## Case Study: BYD  

- **Strengths**: Battery tech, vertical integration, R&D investment.  
- **Weaknesses**: Brand perception in premium markets.  
- **Opportunities**: Global EV demand, diversification (e.g., masks).  
- **Threats**: Price wars, trade barriers.

## New Trends in Strategic Management

### Business Ecosystem

> What's that ?

- Case:
	- Apple: iOS ecosystem, with multiple products
	- Xiaomi: MIUI
- static model of business ecosystem

<img src="21.png" style="zoom:50%">

<img src="22.png" style="zoom:50%">
### Ecosystem Strategy

> At first, think of whether we **build an ecosystem** or **join one**?
>
> And it depends on the **nature of business** and **specific position** it occupies in the competitive landscape

1. Focal【中心的】 firm's ecosystem strategy: think of **value propositions**, layout of value creation
2. Design governance structure of the ecosystem: **defines the roles of the focal firm and the participants** and govern their interactions
3. (ultimate task) create **ecosystem-specific competitive advantages** based on ecosystem specific competencies

## Organizational Change

### Reasons for Change

- External: Market shifts, regulations (e.g., GDPR).  
- Internal: Declining performance, cultural shifts.  

### Lewin’s 3-Step Model

1. **Unfreezing**: Recognize need for change (e.g., Kodak acknowledging digital disruption).  
2. **Changing**: Implement interventions (e.g., adopting cloud infrastructure).  
3. **Refreezing**: Reinforce new norms (e.g., training programs).  

### Resistance to Change

| **Cause**               | **Mitigation Strategy**           |  
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|  
| Fear of uncertainty      | Education & communication.        |  
| Loss of control          | Participation in decision-making. |  
| Habitual routines        | Incentivize new behaviors.        |  

### Organizational Decline Stages

1. **Blinded**: Ignore warning signs (e.g., Blockbuster dismissing streaming).  
2. **Inaction**: Recognize issues but delay action.  
3. **Faulty Action**: Panic-driven decisions (e.g., layoffs without strategy).  
4. **Crisis**: Severe financial/operational collapse.  
5. **Dissolution**: Bankruptcy or acquisition.  



## Area of Change

|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| :one: **Traditional Groups** | Execution<br><font color=red>No</font> direct control |receive reports from workers<br>responsible for workers’ performance<br>authority to hire and fire them|
|:two:**Employee involvement teams**|Provide advice or make <font color=red>suggestions</font><br>do not have the authority to make decisions<br>Membership: voluntary but expertise|make <font color=red>decisions</font><br>(**Basic Logic**: people closest to the problem or situation are best able to recommend solutions.) |
|:three:**Semi-autonomous Groups**|have the <font color=red>(limited) authority</font> to make decisions<br>solve problems related to the major tasks<br>typically cross-trained in diversified skills and tasks|still play a role but <font color=red>less dominant</font>|
| :four:**Self-Managing Teams** |manage and control <font color=red>crucial tasks</font>(high authority)|-|
| :five:**Self-Designing Teams** |Share characteristics of self-managing teams<br>control team design, work tasks, and team membership(<font color=red>full auth</font>)|(all decided by members)|

### Specialized Teams

## Managing Effective Communication
### One-on-One Communication
1. **Choose the Right Medium**:  

   - *Oral*: Immediate feedback, assesses nonverbal cues.  
   - *Written*: Best for straightforward messages.  

2. **Active Listening**:  
   - **Techniques**: Immediacy behaviors (eye contact), paraphrasing, summarizing.  
   - **Empathetic Listening**: Understand speaker’s perspective; reflect feelings (e.g., *"You seem frustrated..."*).

# Section 18. Managing Motivation

## Motivation Fundamentals
### Definition
- Set of forces that **initiates**, **directs**, and sustains effort toward goal achievement.  
- **3 Elements**:  
  1. Initiation of effort
  2. Direction of effort
  3. Persistence of effort

### Motivation-Performance Relationship
| Factor    | Description   |
|----|------------|
| **Job Performance**   | Determined by **motivation**, employee ability, and situational constraints |
| **Effort → Performance** | Effort (initiation/direction/persistence) directly impacts performance    |

### Motivation Model Diagram
<img src="1201.png" style="zoom:60%">



## Needs and Rewards
### Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs
<img src="1202.png" style="zoom:60%">

### Reward Types
| Type               | Description                                  | Example                     |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Extrinsic**      | Tangible rewards contingent on performance   | Salary, bonuses, promotions |
| **Intrinsic**      | Natural rewards from task performance        | Sense of achievement, growth|

### Steps to Motivate
1. Enquire about employees’ needs  
2. Satisfy **lower-order needs** first (safety/physiological)  
3. Expect needs to evolve over time  
4. Create opportunities for **higher-order needs** (intrinsic rewards)  



## Motivation Theories
### 1. Equity Theory
- Motivation arises when people perceive **fair treatment** in:  
  - **Inputs** (contributions) vs. **Outcomes** (rewards)  
  - Compared to **referents** (others)  

<img src="1203.png" style="zoom:60%">

#### Forms of Inequity
| Type          | Description  | Employee Reaction     |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Underreward** | Worse O/I ratio than referent                  | ↓ Inputs, ↑ Outcomes, rationalize, leave |
| **Overreward**  | Better O/I ratio than referent                 | Guilt-driven productivity increase    |

#### Motivating Strategies
- Ensure **distributive justice** (fair reward distribution)  
- Ensure **procedural justice** (fair decision-making processes)  
- Reduce employees’ inputs when appropriate  

### 2. Expectancy Theory
- Motivation depends on belief in:  
  - **Expectancy**: Effort → Performance linkage  
  - **Instrumentality**: Performance → Reward linkage  
  - **Valence**: Reward attractiveness  

#### Motivating Strategies
- Identify employees’ desired rewards
- Link rewards clearly to performance  [目的：提高期望]
- Empower employees to make decision

### 3. Reinforcement Theory
- Behavior frequency changes based on **consequences**:  
  - ↑ with positive consequences  
  - ↓ with negative consequences  

#### Reinforcement Contingencies [强化相倚]
| Type    | Effect on Behavior | Example      |
|-----|---------|----------|
| **Positive Reinforcement** | Strengthens      | 发奖学金   |
| **Negative Reinforcement** | Strengthens      | 将功赎罪        |
| **Punishment** [oppose to NR] | Weakens           | 旷课一日留堂一周 |
| **Extinction** [oppose to PR] | Weakens           | 品行问题取消奖学金 |

#### Reinforcement Schedules
| Schedule    | Description    | Example      |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Continuous**       | Reward after every behavior                  | Commission per sale   |
| **Intermittent**     | Reward at intervals/after behavior averages | Quarterly bonuses          |

**Intermittent Subtypes**

<img src="1204.png" style="zoom:60%">

#### Motivating Strategies
- Steps: Identify, measure, analyse, intervene, and evaluate

### 4. Goal-Setting Theory (Recap Sec 5. Organizational Goals)
- Motivation requires:  
  - **Specific, challenging goals**  
  - **Feedback** on progress 

#### Motivating Strategies
- Ensure goal **acceptance**  
- Provide **frequent, specific feedback**  

### Managerial Actions Summary
| Theory               | Key Actions      |
|----------------------|--------------|
| **Basics**           | Address evolving needs; prioritize intrinsic rewards for higher-order needs |
| **Equity Theory**    | Correct inequities; ensure fair procedures                                 |
| **Expectancy Theory**| Clarify effort→performance→reward links; empower employees                |
| **Reinforcement**    | Use contingencies strategically; avoid punishing desired behaviors        |
| **Goal-Setting**     | Set specific/challenging goals; align with organizational objectives      |

<img src="1301.png" style="zoom:80%">



## Contingency Theories
### 1. Fiedler’s Contingency Model
- **LPC Questionnaire** measures leadership style:  
  - $\gt 64$: Relationship-oriented  
  - $\le 57$: Task-oriented  
  - $58-63$: Flexible  
- **Situational Favourableness** depends on:  
  - Leader-member relations  
  - Task structure  
  - Position power  

<img src="1302.png" style="zoom:80%">

### 2. Hersey & Blanchard’s Situational Theory

### 3. Path-Goal Theory

<font color=dodgerblue>Recap: Expectancy Theory</font>

Increase satisfaction/performance by:  
- Clarifying paths to goals  
- Increasing rewards for goal attainment  

#### Leadership Behaviors
| Behavior                          | Use When...                               |

<img src="1303.png" style="zoom:0.7">

### 4. Normative Decision Theory
#### Decision Styles

- Autocratic $\leftrightarrow$ Consultative $\leftrightarrow$ Group decision

<img src="1304.png">

#### Key Decision Rules
- **For Quality**: 
  - Avoid autocratic style(A) if leader lacks info or problem is unstructed.
  - Avoid G-style if subordinate's **goals** different from org goal
  - Avoid G-style if subordinate lacks info

- **For Acceptance**: Use group style(GII) when:
  - Subordinate acceptance is critical
  - Conflict is likely (about implementation)
  - Goals align with organization



## Visionary Leadership
### Charismatic Leadership
| Type                 | Characteristics                                  |

# Section 20. Organisational Control

## Basic Control Process
- **Definition**: Regulatory process of establishing standards, comparing performance, and taking corrective action

- **Recap:** 4 functions of management

<img src="1305.png" style="zoom:80%">

- **Steps**:

  1. **Build Standard(Benchmark)**

     - Determined by whether it can achieve goal and listen to customer's feedback

  2. **Measuring Performance**

     - Methods comparison:  
       | Method             | Benefits                                      | Drawbacks                                  |
       |--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
       | **Personal Observation** | Firsthand knowledge, unfiltered, intensive   | Biased, time-consuming, obtrusive         |
       | **Statistical Reports** | Easy visualization, shows relationships      | Limited info, ignores subjectivity         |
       | **Oral Reports** | Fast, allows feedback                        | Filtered info, undocumented               |
       | **Written Reports** | Comprehensive, formal, easy to file/retrieve | Time-consuming to prepare                 |

  3. **Comparing to Standards**

     - Determine acceptable range of variation <font color=dodgerblue>(a range of acceptance)</font>

  4. **Taking Corrective Action**

     | Type               | Focus                          |
     |--------------------|--------------------------------|
     | Immediate Action   | Fixes symptoms immediately     |
     | Basic Action       | Corrects root causes of deviation |

- **Cybernetic Process**: 

<img src="1306.png" style="zoom:50%">



## Control Mechanisms
| Type              | Timing          | Function                                    | Example          |
|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Feedforward**   | Before input    | Anticipates problems (preventive)           | Equipment maintenance checks |
| **Concurrent**    | During process  | Corrects issues in real-time                | Quality checks on assembly line |
| **Feedback**      | After output    | Corrects future performance using past data | Customer satisfaction surveys |



## Methods to Maintain Control
| Method             | Basis of Control                          | Key Characteristics                          |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Bureaucratic**   | Rules, policies, hierarchy               | Slow response, resistance to change         |
| **Objective**      | Measurable outputs/behaviors             | Subtypes: Behavior vs. Output control       |
| **Normative**      | Shared values/beliefs                    | Hiring for cultural fit, storytelling       |
| **Concertive**     | Work group values                        | Autonomy-driven, peer pressure              |
| **Self-Control**   | Self-set goals & monitoring              | Personal accountability                    |

**Key Distinctions**:

- Objective Control:  
  - **Behavior control**: Regulates actions (e.g., call center scripts)  
  - **Output control**: Regulates results (e.g., sales targets)  
- Concertive vs. Normative:
  - Concertive emerges from teams
  - Normative from organizational culture.  
  



## Managerial Control Aspects
### 1. Balanced Scorecard
Measures performance across 4 perspectives:  
1. **Financial** (e.g., ROI, EVA)  
2. **Customer** (e.g., retention, satisfaction)  
3. **Internal Operations** (e.g., quality, efficiency)  
4. **Innovation/Learning** (e.g., employee skills, R&D)  

**Benefit**: Prevents suboptimization (improving one area at another’s expense).

### 2. Financial Control Tools
- **Key Ratios**:  
  
  | Objective       | Ratio               | Meaning                          |
  |-----------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
  | Liquidity       | Current Ratio       | Tests short-term solvency        |
  | Leverage        | Debt-to-Assets      | Measures financial leverage      |
  | Activity        | Inventory Turnover | Efficiency of inventory use      |
  | Profitability   | Return on Investment| Asset profit efficiency          |
  
- <font color=red><b>Economic Value Added (EVA):</b></font>  

  - $\text{EVA}=\text{Revenue}-\text{Cost}-\color{blue}\text{Capital Cost}$
  - `Cost` contains expenses, taxes, etc.
  - Cost of capital shows degree of which a project pay for itself


### 3. Customer Defection/Retention Control
- Track **defection rate** to retain profits and gain honest feedback. [判断员工是否计划离职以最小化损失]

### 4. Quality Control
| Quality Measure                  | Advantage(s)                       | Disadvantage(s)                       |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Excellence**                   | Motivational, appeals to customers | Ambiguous, hard to measure            |
| **Value**                        | Customer-focused, measurable       | Difficult to balance cost vs. quality |
| **Conformance to Specification** | Standardizes quality, efficient    | Less adaptable, poor fit for services |

- Total Quality Management(TQM) [灵活变通], principles:
	- Customer focus and satisfaction
	- Continuous improvement
	- Teamwork

### 5. Innovation & Learning
- Focus: Continuous improvement, sustainability (waste reduction → reuse → disposal).

| **Setup**         | Machine adjustment costs for new product runs                               |
| **Holding**       | Storage, insurance, obsolescence                                            |
| **Stockout**      | Lost sales + customer goodwill loss                                         |

### Management Techniques
| Technique       | Principle            | Formula/Application  |
|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **EOQ** (Economic order quantity) | Minimizes ordering + holding costs    | $EOQ=\sqrt{2DO/H}$ |
| **JIT** (Just-in-time) | Near-zero inventory; parts arrive exactly when needed   | Requires supplier proximity + shared IT systems |
| **MRP** (Materials requirement planning) | Production scheduling via: 1) Master schedule 2) Billing of materials 3) Inventory records | For dependent demand systems          |

- Explanation of EOQ:
  - $D$: material usage (e.g. gallons of paint per year)
  - $O$: ordering cost each
  - $H$: holding costs (e.g. dollars per gallons)

### Demand Systems

| Type      | Description   | Suitable Technique |
|-----------|---------------|----|
| **Independent**    | Inventory levels unrelated    | EOQ  |
| **Dependent**      | Inventory types tied to finished goods | JIT or MRP |
