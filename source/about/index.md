# About Me

  I'm Steven(Chinese name: Qijun He) major in Computer Science. Up to my previous update(March 30, 2025), I'm a junior student studying in South University of Science and Technology(SUSTech). Also, I'm still a beginner of computer science since I learned my first program language, Java, in 2023. 

  Now I've learned several program languages, such as `C++`, `Python`, `Java` and experience some popular framework using in projects like `Springboot` and `React`. Not very proficient, but enough to finish most of my courses' projects and some extra researches.

  Since Sep, 2024, the third year of my undergraduate study, I do creative research (a special course in my school, letting students to explore in particular fields) about **Computer Vision**, led by my instructor, Shiqi Yu. In semester 2025 Spring, my team is exploring how to compact a face detection model frame with a multi-class code detection. Up to Apr, 2025, we've succeeded in detecting QRCode and Mini-Program code(like wechat mini-program, Douyin and XiaoHongShu). We are continuing to extend for ArUco and barcode.

  I want to talk about my interest. Actually, what I'd love to explore in computer science lies in **computer vision, deep learning and robotic**. Now I'm still lack of experience on robotic, but I truly hope to try in the future. In three-year learning in computer science, I find myself good at software development, but sometimes I feel terrible coding for front-end, which is frustrating work. Still, using program to fulfill others' requirements makes me feel a sense of achievement.

  I hope to meet with experts in computer science field. Just feel free to contact me through my mailbox 12212131@mail.sustech.edu.cn



# Wanna make friends â€‹ðŸ™‚â€‹

  I wanna talk more (unrelated to my subject) about me, helping myself to make more friends.

  I'm a lover of sports and music. I like badminton and still keep practicing now, although my feet are clumsy. I'm also interested in other ball games like table tennis and basketball. But badminton is still my favorite.

  Music is half of my life. I started to learn the piano at 4, and keep it as my hobby and keep practicing now. I am taking a try to compose some classical-like song now, using my nearly 20-year experience of practicing classical music of piano. And I try to mock the style of Liszt and Chopin (I surppose) because I love them most (this is definitely true). I have to inform that I'm still an amateur player.

  Listening to music is also a way for me to relax. However I seldom listen to classical music, but Jazz and Popular music instead. Some Japanese singer and bands attract me and I love songs that give me power and energy.

  Hope to make friends with whom we have similar interests.



# About this website

  I create this website taking advantage of the Github Personal Page, and edit it with a handy framework named [Hexo](https://hexo.io/zh-cn/). 

  It was a shame that I create and maintain this website too late, so some of the basic courses in my school are not included. If you want to find some basic courses, feel free to view my github repos.

  If my note can be some help to your computer learning, that's my pleasure (because I'm not proficient on it).
